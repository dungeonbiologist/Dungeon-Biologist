Dungeon biologist is a work in progress which intends to become a dungeon ecology simulation

'L' adds a larva
'H' adds a hammercrab
'M' adds a mole
'C' add a gelatinous cube
'D' adds a dwarf

Larva: eats walls that have only one side exposed can only move orthogonally
gelatinous cubes: must stay in contact with a wall at all times. if attacked they excrete a wall, they eat wall slime and hammer-crabs if they find them
moles: eat cubes,  can only destroy walls that are unsupported on the opposite side and flanked by two solid walls
hammercrab: destroys any walls that are exposed on three or more faces,can move slowly on the y axis, eats trantoros 

current planned creatures
Giant Worm:	eats larva, if it gets stuck it turns and knocks out a wall
Trantoro: turns to stone when scared, eats moss
slug:	leaves a slime trail when frightened that slows other creatures down
vampire bush:	spreads when it kills a creature
glow flower:	anything that eats it starts glowing
choke vine:
rock coral: slowly turns into a wall
moths: seeks lit squares, it's eggs only hatch every 500 turns
liveing portal: they come in pairs looks like a p from three sides, like a doorway from one side
Shield bug:	immune to attacks from the front
Grow Troll: enlarges and can knock out walls when angry
thower:	throws items or monsters for defense
floating eye:	raises alarm when scared
trapper:	lays down traps to catch prey
Ballistomycete: when it explodes it produces a few giant spores.
giant spore: once about every 40 turns it produces a Ballistomycete. it leaves a trail of mold covered tiles. when it dies it explodes into several Ballistomycetes
Dwarf prospector: carves out an exponential random walk and deposits doors randomly when diggin out a tile
dwarf minor: (haha) it carves out tiles that are exposed on one corner and it's two orthagonal sides but aren't next to a door
Dragon: if a dwarf walks on a large enough pile of gold it turns into a dragon
spanish eels: hunt in packs and freeze prey
